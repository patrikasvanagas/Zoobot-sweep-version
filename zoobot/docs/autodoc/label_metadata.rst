label_metadata
===================

This module is mostly premade dicts and lists tediously describing the GZ2 and GZ DECaLS decision trees.
These descriptions are used to create the practical python classes in ``schemas.py``.

See the source code for the dicts themselves. 
See the :ref:`Training from Scratch <training_from_scratch>` guide for an explanation of what these are and how they related to ``schemas.py`` and the multi-question loss function.
