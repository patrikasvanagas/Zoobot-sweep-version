Below are some practical guides for tasks that we hope Zoobot will be helpful for.

   /guides/pytorch_or_tensorflow
   /guides/training_from_scratch
   /guides/representations
   /guides/finetuning

These guides include content or code specific to either the PyTorch or TensorFlow versions of Zoobot:

   /guides/training_with_tensorflow
   /guides/training_with_pytorch

If you'd prefer worked examples, you can find those under `zoobot/tensorflow/examples <https://github.com/mwalmsley/zoobot/blob/main/zoobot/tensorflow/examples>`_ and `zoobot/pytorch/examples <https://github.com/mwalmsley/zoobot/blob/main/zoobot/pytorch/examples>`_

There's also this `Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1miKj3HVmt7NP6t7xnxaz7V4fFquwucW2?usp=sharing>`_ demonstrating finetuning which you can run in the cloud (with free access to a powerful GPU, courtesy of Google Research)
